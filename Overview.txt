The AnticipatoRy Complex Adaptive Network Extrapolation (ARCANE) library
is a genetic algorithm system for automatically generating system dynamics
models that differ in both their embedded parameters and their fundamental
equations while maintaining dimensional consistency. It is intended to be
used for anticipatory modeling of systems such as complex networks. This
is an Apache Spark harness for ARCANE.
